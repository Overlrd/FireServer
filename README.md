# FireServer

While building my portfolio, I decided to make the contents dynamic using Firebase. It was challenging to hide the Firebase config keys, and since I don't want anyone outside to have access to my keys, I created a simple HTTP server.


This server is connected to my Firebase project and renders the content I need based on the routes.
